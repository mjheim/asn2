	In this program we worked with file IO in C. The program was developed to help Mr. Krabs clean up and organize his files. This program processes file names provided on the command line. The program includes many commands, such as 'c'. 'c' Lists the current file to the screen. Command 'd' copies the current file using file read and write and puts the data into a duplicate file. 'u' deleted the currently selected file that is being edited by the user. The 't' command zeros the current file length using a truncate action to delete the contents of the file. The 'a' command appends the current files contents tot another file that is selected by the user. This is a similar process to the copy file command in its processes. The 'l' command displays the last 100 bytes of the current file. Even if there are less than 100 bytes it will output the last bytes of the current file being processed by the user. The 'm' command changes the current file's access permissions using the chmod command. 'x' will change the current file's access time using utimestat to replace the access time with the current time. 'n' will go directly to the next file in the list of arguments and if the user enters 'q' as a command it will quit the program.
