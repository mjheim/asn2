Test 1: 
input:	mheim@woodstock:~/cs366/asn2$ ./a.out a.txt b.txt c.txt

output:
	’c’ list the current file

	’r’ rename the current file
	’u’ delete (unlink) the current file
	't' zero (length) the current file
	'a' append the current file to another file
	'l' display the last 100 bytes of the curent file
	'm' change the current file's access permissions
	'x' change the current file's access to the current time
	'n' go to the next file
	'q' quit
